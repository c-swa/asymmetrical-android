## about
Asymmetrical Android is an android app that differs from many stock note apps. Rather than store its data as a .txt file or in a database, it uses the standard file system structure of folders and files to store data. The base file that stores the note is .json; JSON will allow for a more flexible and intuitive storage system rather than a SQL-lite database. While a database would allow for plenty of modification, and different file types, JSON would accommodate for ease of porting notes, entries, and files outside of the app to other systems.
