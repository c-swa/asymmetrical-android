# Asymmetrical

## About
Due to a lack of a proper 'stock' Reminders app, and Google Keep's unfortunate tracking, or Google's track record of abandoning projects, I wanted to build a proper app that looks modern, and is well engineered for keeping track of things. Currently the app will be simple as I learn Kotlin and Jetpack Compose UI. 

## Current Status
- [ ] Composable UI
- [ ] Saving to local database
- [ ] Push Notifications

## Future Releases
- [ ] Note taking ability
- [ ] Export capability to [Markdown?]
