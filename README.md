# Asymmetrical-Android
Repository for an Android App for Computer Science 449 at UMKC

## About
Asymmetrical Android is an Android app that I have designed because I did not like the stock Android note taking experience. When I embarked upon the creation of this app, there aren't many well suited apps that I liked. Thus, I will create my own. Here, is where I decided that I will be continuing the app development outside of the course that is taught at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. As a part of my summer goals found [here](https://christopherswayne.com/post/summer_plans), I am continuing to develop the app for Android, until I have a stable v-1.0 release that I can comfortably export as a full app. I don't currently have any plans to upload the final project to the Google Play Store, but I intend to build it into an APK file that can be sideloaded for anyone to use. The source code is here, and auditable, as to allow others to expand upon my work, and for there to be evidence of no data collection or privacy invasive portions of code.
